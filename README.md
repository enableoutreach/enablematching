This is currently a proof of concept developed with Ruby on Rails.  It demonstrates the main features of a proposed e-NABLE matching system.  The main features include:
* User management with ALL private data being hidden from other users
* Request an e-NABLE device
* Offer to create a requested device
* Mechanisms for storing measurements and photos
* Simple messaging platform for communications without exchanging private contact info
* Ratings and reviews to allow the community to police itself
* Team features that allow a group/chapter to centrally manage multiple device requests
